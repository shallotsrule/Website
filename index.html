    <h1>Introduction to Web Design</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Derek, I come from Massachusetts, and I plan to major in computer science and mathematics. I code
        promarily in Java and C++, but also have minimal experience in HTML and python. I usually code to make
        GUI applications and games as well as occasionally learn about cybersecurity, cryptography, and AI. Outside
        of coding, I like to cook, play the violin, do photography, play video games, and a few other things.
